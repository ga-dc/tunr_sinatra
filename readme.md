# Tunr 1.0!

We're going to be building Tunr, the worlds #1 music catalog / player (those
Spotify haters can't keep up with us).

## Part 1 - Database / Schema

In this exercise, your goal is to build out the schema for tunr, load it with
seed data, and run some sample queries to explore the data.

### Create the database

Create a postgres database called `tunr_db`. Make sure to use that **exact**
name, or you'll have trouble later on!

### Create a schema

Inside the db folder, create a `schema.sql` file, and then load it into your
`tunr_db` database.

Here's what our data model looks like:

*Artists*

| column name  | type |
|--------------|------|
| id   | primary key (int) |
| name | text |
| photo_url | text |
| nationality | text |

*Songs*

| column name  | type |
|--------------|------|
|id | primary key (int) |
|title | text |
|album | text |
|preview_url | text |
|artist_id | foreign key (int) |

### Load the Seed Data

Use psql to load the seed data located in `db/seed.sql`

### Play with the data

Using `psql`, play with the database, come up with some interesting sample
queries, and save them in a file in the db folder called `sample_queries.sql`

## Part 2.1 - Create the Artist Model using Active Record

1. Create an app.rb file for this application
2. Create a Gemfile using `bundle init`
3. Create a folder for your models (it should be called `models`)
4. Create a file that will contain your AR class definition for 'artists'
5. Add your dependencies into the Gemfile and then run `bundle install`


## Part 2.2 - Define artists & setup your app.rb to connect to the database

1. Define your artist model in `models/artist.rb`
2. Require your dependencies in `app.rb`
3. Establish connection to database using AR
4. Load pry at the end of `app.rb`

## Part 2.3 - Use your Artist Model

In the console:

1. Find all artists
2. Find just one artist by id
3. Find Taylor Swift (or your other fav artist) by **name**.
4. Find all artists from the USA
5. Find all artists NOT from the USA
6. Create a new artist for your favorite artist
7. Change at least 2 of their attributes
8. Destroy the artist you just created
  - (NOTE: If you destroy other artists at this point, you'll need to reseed your data for consistency.)

## Part 2.4 - Create your Song Model / Setup Associations

1. Create a file that will contain your AR class definition for Songs
2. Make sure to link that file in your main application file
3. Add corresponding associations to your models

## Part 2.5 - Use your Model Associations

In the console...  

1. Find the artist with the name Enya
2. Use AR methods to find all of Enya's songs, store them in a variable
3. Get the first song out of those results and get that song's title
4. Find the song with the title 'Unstoppable' and store in a variable
5. Get that song's artist, store that in a variable
6. Reassign the song's artist to be a different one (your choice)
7. Save that song
8. Create a new song, and associate it with a different artist of your choice
9. Delete that song
10. Find all of Enya's songs again, store in a variable
  - Using `each`, iterate over those songs and for each song, print "I like" + the song name

## Part 3 - Build a RESTful Interface using Sinatra

First you wrote the schema for a database to store records of artists and their songs for a music catalog app. You then seeded the database with sample data and we were able to interact with that data (performing CRUD operations) using SQL queries in Postgresql. Next, you connected ActiveRecord to the database which enhanced your ability to interact with the data in a Ruby environment. Still, our only way to interact with the data is in a console.

Today, you are going to use Sinatra to listen for HTTP requests and serve HTML (rendered from ERB templates) in response.

### Part 3.1: Root Route, Home View, and Layout View

1. Run your application: `ruby app.rb` and go to localhost:4567 in your browser... Sinatra doesn't know this ditty.

  - First just define the route in the General Routes section of app.rb as described by Sinatra:
    ```ruby
    get '/' do
      "Hello World"
    end
    ```
  Now head back to localhost:4567 and check it out!

  - So maybe not super exciting but moving in the right direction

  - Replace `"Hello World"` with HTML rendered from an ERB template, home. Our General Routes section of app.rb now reads:
    ```ruby
    get '/' do
      erb :home
    end
    ```

- [erb](http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro.html#Views%20/%20Templates) is a method provided by Sinatra which uses Ruby's [ERB (Embedded RuBy)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERuby) templating system to take a template string (text with ruby written in it) and produce an output string after evaluating the embedded ruby.

- If we tried to go to localhost:4567 now, we'd get an error saying __No such file or directory @ rb_sysopen - /path/to/tunr_sinatra/views/home.erb__

    - When we give the `erb` method an argument of `:home`, the method looks in the __views/__ directory of the project for a file named home.erb and takes the contents of that file as its template string.

    - Make that __views/__ directory and add a file home.erb.

    - In home.erb, first add some HTML (no need to worry about embedding ruby just yet) and check it out at localhost:4567

- The erb method will also check for [a layout.erb file](http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro.html#Templates%20with%20%3Ccode%3Eyield%3C/code%3E%20and%20nested%20layouts) where you define the part of the template shared by all the pages in our app (e.g. head/body elements, header/footer, navigation bar, etc). In layout.erb need to include a line of embedded ruby with the keyword `<%= yield %>`. This tells the method to render the named template (`:home`) at this point in the layout.erb template. In the below steps, regularly check out localhost:4567 and consider the effects of your code changes

    - Make a layout.erb file in views/

    - As always, start simple, maybe just a heading. Check it out in the browser

    - Then expand adding head and body elements, layout.erb should produce well formed HTML and since there is no embedded ruby in it yet, it should be well formed HTML

    - We also want to add a stylesheet which will be shared by all of our pages. Sinatra will by default look for a particular folder for [static assets](http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro.html#Static%20Files).

    - Back in layout.erb add a link to your stylesheet in the head. In the body add a nav element containing links to '/artists' and '/songs'. Finally below the nav element, add an embedded ruby expression calling `yield`.

    - Take a moment using your browser's dev tools to look at how the HTML rendered in from home.erb nests into the HTML rendered from layout.erb where we included `<%= yield %>`.

    - Spend a few minutes making this page look nice/pleasant -- as you keep working on the app, you're going to see it a whole bunch

### Part 3.2: Artist Controller and Views

1. Instead of listing all of our routes in app.rb (which one could do but it gets messy quickly), in general practice we import routes relating to a particular model from a file called a controller. As our codebase grows, we can quickly find a particular route by looking in the correct file. Create a file __artists_controller.rb__ which will hold the routes for your artists

  - We have talked about CRUD operations as covering most of what we want to do with data: Create, Read, Update, and Destroy.

  - You want to allow your user means to perform these four operations on the artists in your database. In this section you will define seven routes for artists which allow your user to perform these actions: __Don't put these routes in yet, if you add them as you need, a workflow is produced organically__

    1. Index (index all artists) - GET "/artists"

    2. Show (show particular artist) - GET "/artist/:id"

    3. New (render form to create new artists) - GET "/artists/new"

    4. Edit (render form to edit existing artist) - GET "/artists/:id/edit"

    5. Create (submit form to create new artist) - POST "/artists"

    6. Update (submit form to update existing artist) - PUT "/artists/:id"

    7. Destroy (delete an existing artist) - DELETE "/artists/:id"

- Make your __Index__ route for artists

  - In the browser, try to follow the link to "/artists" in your nav bar. You see Sinatra doesn't know this ditty. Not shocking as you have not yet defined it.

  - While it is possible to put the "/artists" route in app.rb, it helps keeps thing organized to keep a separate file where we define all of our artist routes and then use `require_relative` to import that file. These kinds of files which handle interaction between our models and our views are our controllers. Put the route Sinatra suggests in  artists_controller.rb
    ```ruby
    get "/artists" do
      "Hello World"
    end
    ```

  - Be sure to add the following in your app.rb
    ```ruby
    require_relative 'artists_controller.rb'
    ```

  - Check out the browser again and see the greeting "hello world".

- Make your __Index__ view for artists.

  - Now we want to serve a better response.

  -  `"Hello World"` with `erb :"artists/index"`. Now Sinatra is looking for `/path/to/tunr_sinatra/views/artists/index.erb` (the reason we organize our views this way will become apparent as you make more). Make the artists/ directory inside of views/, and create the file index.erb in the views/artists/ directory

  - Add a heading to the artists index page.

  - As home.erb did, the artist/index.erb template will render nested within our layout.erb template.

- Now in the controller you want to get data from the database (by means of ActiveRecord and our models) and use it to render the views (using erb).

  - In your GET /artists route add binding.pry.
    ```ruby
    get "/artists" do
      binding.pry
      erb :"artists/index"
    end
    ```

  - Pull up the terminal when you reload the artists page to begin working in pry. Note, the page will not load until you exit pry and if you load the page multiple times, multiple pry sessions will open. Use your Artist model to get the array of all artists (like in [Part 2.3](##part-2-3) above).

  - In the artist controller, where you had binding.pry, declare an instance variable referencing the array of all artists so [it can be used  in your view](https://github.com/ga-dc/curriculum/blob/master/04-ruby-mvc-sinatra/sinatra-rest/views.md#passing-variables-to-views).

  - In the artist index view, [iterate over the artists names](https://github.com/ga-dc/curriculum/blob/master/04-ruby-mvc-sinatra/sinatra-rest/views.md#more-complex-ruby-with-erb)

  - Check out localhost:4567/artists, pretty neat.

- What pages do we want to link to on this page? Which of the seven routes described above would it make sense to have links to on this page?

  - Looking at each of them:

    - __Index__ of artists? Not really, already on it

    - __Show__ a particular artist? It would be really nice to click an artist and see their page.

    - Show a page with a form to add a __new__ artist? Would be nice if we are looking at all our artists and realize there is one we would like to add to have that form right there.

    - Show a page with a form to __edit__ an existing artist? This probably makes most sense on the page for a particular artist

    - POST a form to __create__ a new artist? This necessarily is going to be with the __new__ form

    - PUT a form to __update__ an existing artist? Similar to above, this necessarily belongs with the edit form

    - __Delete__ an artist? Like edit, this also makes sense on the page of a particular artist

  - In views/artists/index.erb template a page which uses the artists array to list all of the artists and includes a link to the new artist form page.

- __Creating__ new artists

  - Trying to follow the links to the new artist page will lead to the same "Sinatra doesn't know this ditty" error.

  - In the artist controller, define a route for GET "artists/new" and create your new page: views/artists/new.erb. The new page should have a [form which makes a POST request](https://github.com/ga-dc/curriculum/blob/master/04-ruby-mvc-sinatra/sinatra-rest/rest.md#post) to "/artists"

  - Now in the artist controller when you define the route for POST "/artists", use the .create method of your Artist Model (like in [Part 2.3](##part-2-3) above) to create a record of an artist in the database using params to access the information your user posted in the form. After we create our artist, redirect to the artists index where you should see your new artist added to the list.

- __Showing__ an artist

  - Thinking back to our artist index page, a plain text list of the artists in the database isn't super useful, even with the very impressive ability to add to that list. What we would like to do is give each individual artist a page. ERB is going to be an enormous asset here. You can define a generic template for showing an artist and then provide the view an artist instance with which to render the form.

    - The challenge here is to [take information from](https://github.com/ga-dc/curriculum/tree/master/04-ruby-mvc-sinatra/sinatra-rest#the-params-hash) the GET artists/:id and use that with ActiveRecord to retrieve the artist instance requested. Spend a little time in pry playing with these ideas.

- __Updating__ an artist

  - HTML forms only support GET and POST methods so we need to use a work-around to use our PUT and DELETE methods we need for updating and deleting artists. We create a form with `action='/artist/<id here>' method='post'` and any form elements we need but the first child of the form should be `<input type="hidden" name="_method" value="put">` or `value="delete"` for the delete route. In the ERB it looks like:
      ```html
      <form method="post" action="/artists/3">
        <input type="hidden" name="_method" value="put">
      </form>
      ```

    - The form for deleting doesn't need its own page so can go on the Artist page. However we should link to a new page which holds the edit form.

- Finishing the routes

  - Using the techniques covered so far, you have the means implement the 7 RESTful routes discussed above for artists  and create the views for your routes to respond with (giving your user full CRUD functionality over your database!).

### Part 3.3 (Bonus)

- If you are comfortable, begin implementing routes for songs -- consider carefully how a user wants to access songs. Remember that CRUD and ISNECUD are more ideas than hard and fast rules and we structure our app in a way that makes sense to how it will be used.

### Part 3.4 (Super bonus)

- Add a third model of playlists to the app
- Use [Haml](haml.info) instead of ERB for templating

### Part 3.5 (You're either time-traveling or not sleeping bonus)

- Add users and account management
